// The game manager removes the player if he's  dead and sets him back

// we have refactored the game manager as much as possible

// There are some other things that we can also refactor

// this.gameOver is a quick fix for all the madness that is going on 

//this.game over is the global variable we are using to call the game over screen

//We only get into each of those if statements if game over is false


// if it is true we can not add any more points


// we need to apply this.gameOver to something that will call the game over clean

//we reduced lines of code that were repetitive 

// A bollean means either true or false and it is a variable type

// we are automatically calling the game over function with 2 intenitions

//what we basically did was we set the values up for when a user purchases a power up and we set up the cost of the experience

// the user can now use the experience he/she has and buy powerups so far we only have 1 power up that is available to be purchased

//Basically what we did in video 46 was we set up the spendGold function

// we also added a picture of it in the title screen

// we linked everything together that had to do with the spendGold funciton


//When the user presses the buy button we want to pause the game

//we are setting up the function to where the buy key is pressed

// resume is what we use as the pause function in stopBuying

//the opacity is adjustable to the user can still get a glimpse of what is going on in the game at the current time

// The reson why we unbind the key is so people can not randomly make purchases

// this.updateWhenPaused will only work if it is after this.font

// we had to add a z value for our "B" button to wrk

// we had to add the z value for the text to show up

// we are adding new upgrades to be able o be purchased for upgrading your player

// We are setting up the names and buttons of these upgrades

// we also added the cost and the current level for each of these upgrades or powerups

// now we are going to set up our buttons to specific functions

// checkBuyKeys only checks the key presses

// we pass a prameter on checkCost so it is universal and it works on all skills 


// if we do not have enough we will return false

// your skill will have one added to it and multiply by 10
